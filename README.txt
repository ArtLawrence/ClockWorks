This file explains that this is an experimental "testing of the waters" of GIT.
The attempt will be for a local repository located at:
~/ClockWorks.

This is a project I'm working on as a module in the SkillCrush Wordpress blueprint.
The module is 102 javaScript and the project is to build a LOLCat clock.

-rev a just testingâ€¦

So I moved the repository because I'm trying to clean up the directory structure on my computer...
It's currently a mess, with stuff all over the place so I want to consolidate it all...

 I just figured out why vscode was showing 5000 files being tracked that I didn't expect...
 I put the fix in notes.
