This file explains that this is an experimental "testing of the waters" of GIT.
The attempt will be for a local repository located at:
/Users/artl/Documents/tester/ClockWorks.

This is a project I'm working on as a module in the SkillCrush Woerdpess blueprint.
The module is 102 javaScript and the project is to build a LOLCat clock.
